# Post-fire-hydrophobicity
Analysis of mechanisms responsible for post fire hydrophobicity decay

This repository includes code and data used within manuscript titled "Freeze-Thaw Processes Degrade Post-fire Water Repellency in Wet Soils" submitted to the Hydrological Processess Journal. 

Code folder includes

Data folder includes laboratory data hydrophobicity (measured by MED test) and soil organic matter (measured by Wilkey-Black test) for the 11 repeated cycles of freeze/thaw (wet soil),  freeze/thaw (dry soil), wet/freeze/thaw, wet/dry/freeze/thaw, and wet/dry. There are 6 replicas of the MED measurement and 3 replicas of the SOM measurement.
